TODO:
- Start recording from LiveTV

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Listing of EPG entries may have some issues as a HACK is being used to synthesize the unique
  broadcast ID (which MythTV doesn't expose)
- The listing of Timers may have the next scheduled start time appear in the past. This is because
  MythTV's model for scheduling is different to XBMC PVR. This may be resolvable by passing the 
  next recording date across the interface, but more testing is required to ensure that doesn't
  impact anything else.

UNSUPPORTED:
The following areas will not be supported by the MythTV addon for XBMC as the PVR concepts do not
map to MythTV.
- Rename Timer. Schedules in MythTV (aka Timers in XBMC PVR) do not have names. The title of the 
  schedule in MythTV is used directly by the scheduler to match to shows in the EPG to determine
  what to record.
